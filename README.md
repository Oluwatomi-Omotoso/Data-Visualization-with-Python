### _50 ML Projects Before the Year Ends_

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!

This repo documents my personal challenge to **build 50 machine learning projects before the year ends**.  
It’s my way of mastering ML through consistency, exploration, and real-world practice.

## 📂 Project Structure
Every project will include:
- **Problem Statement**  
- **Dataset / Data Source**  
- **Implementation Notebook or Script**  
- **Results & Evaluation**  
- **Key Takeaways**
